# randomscreenshot
Literally only a button which when you click it displays a random screenshot from prnt.sc

do whatever you want with the code its literally 23 lines of html and js idrc

for some reason github pages doesnt wanna work with it xD

# Why?
I was bored

# What can you use it for?
Having a game with your friends where the first one to get a predefined thing on a screenshot wins or sum idk
